# Odd-Projects

Simply planning on putting any odd work I do here and learning Git at the same time.

4/10/2016 - Added Hangman and DictMake
  - Used word list from https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english (20k.txt)
  - Issues: Need to fix files not opening, need to figure out how to include necessary txts in .jar
  -       : Want to clean up code, eg by making a class that handles setting up the game
